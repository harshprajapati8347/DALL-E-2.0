# Build and Deploy a Full Stack MERN AI Image Generation App : DALL E Clone

## DALL-E 2.0 - AI Image Generation

This is a full stack MERN app that uses the DALL-E 2.0 AI model to generate images from text descriptions. The app is a clone of the original DALL-E app created by Me using OPEN AI API. 

I made it using MERN stack, Cloudinary for Image Optimization, Vite (to set React Development Environment), and awesome Tailwind-CSS.
